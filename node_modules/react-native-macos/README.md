$ open macos/MyProject.xcodeproj
```

## Documentation
Since React Native macOS is just a fork, you can follow [the same instructions on the React Native Documentation](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html#content).

## Disclaimer
React Native macOS is a fork of React Native for iOS. The library is still fairly new so proceed at your own risk. There has been no successful story for any React Native macOS application yet, so it's not proven by production use.

## Community Help
Feel free to ask anything on `#react-native-platforms` channel on Reactiflux if you happen to run into problems.

## Examples
